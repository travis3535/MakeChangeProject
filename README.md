## Make Change Project
## Week 2 Homework

### Overview
This is a "Cash Register" project. The design is to first enter in the cost of an item, then enter the amount tendered by the 
customer. The program will calculate up the total amount of each denomination needed to return correct change to the customer.
The program will also display only the denominations needed, and will not display the others.

### Concepts
* Continue Statements
* Casting 
* Rounding

### Technology Used
* Java 
* While loops
* If-statements

### Lessons Learned

I learned a lot from this homework with rounding and more complex if statements. This homework made me really think out the 
logic of what I wanted to do, and what the code really needed to accomplish. There were many times I used a white board to map 
out my code giving me a little better structure and reference.
